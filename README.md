# salt-states
Salt States for use in the local salt-call configuration method.

## TODO
 * Figure out how to pull down these states to a deployed server.
 * Writing out the pillar data in a secure manner using the str\_replace feature.
 * Writing out the pillar and salt top files. The salt top file will control which states get run on the box.
 * Target Ubuntu first, and then write in CentOS and other distro support later.
 * Circle testing of this repo. Linting and functional testing.
